Putting PVs on raw block devices can cause duplicate label issues with 
multipathing.  Those often annoy customers more than the performance hit from 
misalignment.  The fdisk expert mode hack that EMC is recommending basically 
pads the partition table to preserve alignment without risking duplicate label 
issues, but really we should have a feature to do this automatically.
